## How to file issues and get help  

This project uses GitHub Issues to track bugs and feature requests. Please search the existing 
issues before filing new issues to avoid duplicates.  For new issues, file your bug or 
feature request as a new Issue.

For help and questions about using this project, there is no official support chat channel.  However, there are relevant discussion channels for the technologies utilized in this repository.  Please consider utilizing one of these channels as it relates to the technology for desired support:

1. Cluster API for Azure (CAPZ) - [weekly office hours](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api-provider-azure?tab=readme-ov-file#office-hours) and [Kubernetes slack channel](https://kubernetes.slack.com/messages/CEX9HENG7)
2. Crossplane - [community meetings](https://github.com/crossplane/crossplane?tab=readme-ov-file#get-involved) and [slack channel](https://slack.crossplane.io/)
3. GitOps Bridge - [CNCF slack channel](https://cloud-native.slack.com/archives/C06GA4TNPPH)

    The GitOps Bridge is a good starting place for Terraform and ArgoCD questions related to this repository, but for fundamental or advanced support for these technologies specifically consider [Terraform community](https://www.terraform.io/community) and [ArgoCD community](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/?tab=readme-ov-file#community) channels directly.
